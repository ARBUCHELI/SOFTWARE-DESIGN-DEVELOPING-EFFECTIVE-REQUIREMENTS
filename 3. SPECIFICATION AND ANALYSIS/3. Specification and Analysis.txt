# 3. Specification and Analysis
-------------------------------

* User-stories
--------------

* From System to User
---------------------

			WHAT SYSTEM SHALL DO				WHAT USERS WANT
			--------------------				---------------
			. SYSTEM SHALL auto-populate 			. AS A STUDENT, I WANT TO see the
			student's schedule based on 			schedule of my classes so that I
			registered classes from the 			may know when I can register for
			university's academic calendar			other events

			* USER STORY: A REQUIREMENT ARTICULATED FROM A USER'S PERSPECTIVE
				. EXAMPLE
				-------
					. View event-list
					-----------------
						As a student, I want to view a list of events for today so that I may register for them.


						AS A <USER-TYPE>, I WANT <TO DO A TASK> SO THAT <A GOAL>.
		        				{Who}		     {What}		 {Why}


						. EXAMPLE: . VIEW EVENT-LIST: AS A STUDENT, I WANT TO VIEW A LIST OF EVENTS FOR TODAY SO THAT I MAY REGISTER FOR THEM


			* CONDITIONS OF SATISFACTION: ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA OF CONFIRMATION
				. EXAMPLE
				---------
					. View event-list
					-----------------
						As a student, I want to view a list of events for today so that I MAY REGISTER FOR THEM.

					. Conditions of satisfaction
					----------------------------
						. Verify that all events are listed
		
						. Verify that events registered for are marked so
			
						. Verify that conflicts are shown


* Epics
-------
Not all user stories are the same.  Some of them are Epics.  High-level functionalities, very vague. They give a big picture of what the user wants, But often cannot be completed within
a sprint.

* User-Stories
--------------
Requirement articulated from a user's perspective

* Features
----------
Come somewhere between high level epics and low-level stories

* Theme
-------
Collection of related stories


			* Story Mapping
			---------------
				. User stories
				--------------
					- Decomposed

					- Sequenced

					- Themed

					- Prioritized


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Use-cases
-----------

1. User Story
-------------
A short description of a requirement from the user's perspective

As a <user-type> I want to <task> so that <goal>


2. Use case
-----------
An interaction between the system and an actor through which the actor achieves some value



* Use Case Template
-------------------
. Title

. Primary actors

. Secondary actors

. Preconditions

. Basic flow

. Alternative flows

. Postonditions


* Example
---------
. Title: view event schedule

. Primary actor: student

. Secondary actor: 
academic calendar

. Precondition: 
	- UniCal application is open

	- Student is logged into UniCal

	- UniCal's option to view schedule is visible

			WE SHOULD NOT SPECIFY THE SPECIFIC GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE DETAILS SUCH AS MENUS OR BUTTONS IN A USE CASE SPECIFICATION

			TWO REASONS:
			------------
				. WE HAVE NOT DESIGNED THE USER INTERFACE YET.

				. IT IS LIKELY THAT IT MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE ITERATIONS.

. Basic flow:
-------------
1. Student chooses the option to view event schedule.

2. UniCal gives options to choose the period for event schedule.

3. Student chooses the period.

4. UniCal displays the list of events scheduled in the period with an option to exit the view.

5. Student views the schedule and exits.

6. Use case end successfully.


. Alternate flow:
-----------------
1. After step 2 in basic flow, student selects period for which no events are scheduled.

2. UniCal displays a message to convey the above with an option to exit.

3. Student exists.


. Postcondition
---------------
. UniCal is back to its original open state.



* Use Case vs. User Story
-------------------------

Use Case							User Story
--------							----------
. Originated in unified						. Originated as part of scrum framework
process methodology

. Represents a user interaction					. Represents a user need

. Requirements analyzed and 					. Requirements understood
captured in a document						through conversations

. Suitable for projects with complex requirements		. Suitable for projects with small collocated teams and frequent access to the user
and large distributed teams


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Data requirements
-------------------
Capturing the characteristics of the data is as critical as understanding the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.

* Data characteristics
----------------------
Functional and Non-functional

. Functional
------------
Focuses on the internal characteristics of the data or its meaning

. Non-functional
----------------
Focuses on:

	. Source
	. Destination
	. Format
	. Frequency
	. Volume
	. Volatility
	. Integrity
	. Consistency

For example if you are developing a financial accounting application, you cannot understand its functionality unless you understand terms such as debit, credit, assets, liabilities, 
balance sheet, and income statement.

The data content or its meaning, represents domain knowledge.

This domain knowledge about domain specific terms and their meaning is captured in a data dictionary.

		A DATA DICTIONARY IS A COLLECTION OF DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE DATA ENTITIES USED IN AN APPLICATION.

		THE DICTIONARY SHOULD BE CONSTANTLY UPDATED AS NEW REQUIREMENTS ARE DEVELOPED, AND THE TEAM ACQUIRES NEW UNDERSTANDING ABOUT DIFFERENT TERMS.

		FROM DATA DICTIONARY YOU CAN THEN MOVE ON TO A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF DATA THAT RELATES TO ITS ACCESS.  YOU NEED TO MAP WHICH ACTOR HAS WHAT KIND OF ACCESS TO VARIOUS
		DATA ELEMENTS.

		ONE WAY TO CAPTURE THIS IS TO USE A CRUD MATRIX.

Event
-----
. Seminar
. Conference
. Lecture
. Celebration

Members
-------
. Employee
. Student 
. Visitors

Event Schedule
--------------
. Date
. Time


		* A CRUD MATRIX HELPS TO IDENTIFY ANY MISSED REQUIREMENTS.

		AS THE DATA FLOWS FROM INPUT TO OUTPUT, THE PROCESSES THAT IT CAN GO THROUGH CAN BE MODELED USING DATA FLOW DIAGRAMS OR DFD'S.

		* DATA FLOW DIAGRAMS (DFDS) PROVIDE A BIG-PICTURE VIEW OF HOW DATA MOVES THROUGH A SYSTEM.

		* ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAMS (ERDS) USED IN REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS, FOCUS ON RELATIONSHIPS AMONG DATA ENTITIES IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR IMPLEMENTATION IN A DATABASE.
