# 5. Requirement Management
---------------------------

* Effort estimation
-------------------

. Planning Poker
---------------
A consensus-based estimation technique used in SCRUM methodology in which the entire team collaboratively comes up with the effort required to complete a product backlog item


. Three important concepts used in planning poker
-------------------------------------------------

1) Product Backlog Item
-----------------------
A requirement to be implemented

May be a feature, user story, an epic, a defect, on an enhancement

2) Story Point
--------------
Unit of effort

Based on complexity and size

Often relative


3) Velocity
-----------
Amount of work completed in each sprint

Expressed as number of story points per sprint


* Example
---------
1) In a Story Map, each cell is a user story.  
2) The team picks up a user story, uses the planning poker technique, and assigns story points to the user story.


* Estimation
------------
. Scrum master facilitates

. Product owner explains the product backlog item

. Team discusses and asks clarifying questions

. Team members individually select their poker card

. Team members reveal their card

. If estimates differ, then another round of discussion is conducted, especially with the highest and lowest estimators

. Team members reselect their card

. Team repeats this cycle until consensus is reached


		**** VERY IMPORTANT POINT FOR THE PROJECT **** (Software Design: Developing Effective Requirements - Neelam Dwivedi, Software Requirements by Karl Wiegers and Joy Betty,

							       https://www.utm.mx/~caff/doc/OpenUPWeb/index.htm)

		ONE STANDARD IN THE INDUSTRY IS 2 STORY POINTS FOR EACH REQUIREMENT, 15 TO 18 STORY POINTS FOR A SPRINT 
		(THAT MEANS THAT IN A SPRINT IS POSSIBLE TO COMPLETE 7 REQUIREMENTS), AND A SPRINT OF TWO WEEKS.

		TEAMS GIVE ESTIMATES BASED ON THE KNOWN FACTORS AT THE TIME OF THE ESTIMATION.  IF A UNKNOWN FACTOR APPEARS, THEN THE ESTIMATION NEEDS TO BE RECONSIDERED.


* Important Considerations
--------------------------
. Story points are relative and vary with the team

. Estimates are not commitments

. Velocity is historical and often expressed as a range

. Teams get better in estimation over time

* Prioritization
----------------

* Requirement Prioritization
----------------------------

- A way to 

. Implement most valuable functionality early

. Reduce risk

. Deal with competing stakeholder demands

- Also known as requirements triage


* Prioritization Participants
-----------------------------
. Customers

. Sponsors

. Project Team

. Support Team


* Prioritization Factors
------------------------
. Value to Customer

. Requirement Dependencies

. Technical risk


* Prioritization Techniques
---------------------------
. In or Out

. Pairwise comparison and rank ordering

. N-level scales


* In or Out
-----------
. Partipants identify minimum requirements for first release

. Make a binary decision: Is it in or it is out?

. The ones marked "in" are implemented in first iteration

. The ones marked "out" are taken through same process for next release


* Pairwise Comparison and Rank Ordering
---------------------------------------
. Compare requirements in pairs to determine which one is more important

. Assign requirement score based on number of times it got elected as more important in a pair


* N-Level Scale
---------------
. Three-level scale: high, medium, low

. MoSCoW: must, should, could, won't
